        Warning: as there are only two buffers, and the returned tensors reuse the buffer, you cannot hold more than 2

        Arguments:

            topk_idx: `torch.Tensor` with `torch.int64`, shaped as `[num_tokens, num_topk]`, only several top-k shapes
                are supported. `-1` indices (not selecting any expert) are supported.
            num_max_dispatch_tokens_per_rank: the maximum number of tokens to dispatch, all the ranks must hold the same value.
            num_experts: the number of all experts.
            cumulative_local_expert_recv_stats: a cumulative expert count tensor for statistics, which should have shape
                `[num_local_experts]` and be typed as `torch.int`. This is useful for online service EP load balance
                monitoring.
            dispatch_wait_recv_cost_stats: a cumulative time spent waiting to receive each token tensor for statistics,
                which should have shape `[num_ranks, num_ranks]` and be typed as `torch.int64`.
                This is useful for detecting and pre-cisely localizing slow anomalies.
            use_fp8: whether to enable FP8 casting, with this, the received data will be a tuple of FP8 tensor and scaling factors.
            round_scale: whether round the scaling factors into power of 2.
            use_ue8m0: whether use UE8M0 as scaling factor format (available only with `round_scale=True`).
            async_finish: the current stream will not wait for the communication kernels to be finished if set.
            return_recv_hook: return a receiving hook if set. If set, the kernel will just do the RDMA request issues,
                but **without actually receiving the data**. You must call the received hook to make sure the data's arrival.
                If you do not set this flag, the kernel will ensure the data's arrival.

            recv_x: a tensor or tuple with received tokens for each expert.

                `[num_local_experts, num_max_dispatch_tokens_per_rank * num_ranks, hidden]` with `torch.float8_e4m3fn`.
                The second tensor is the corresponding scales for the first element with shape
                `[num_local_experts, num_max_dispatch_tokens_per_rank * num_ranks, hidden // 128]` with `torch.float`,
                if `use_ue8m0=False`. With `use_ue8m0=True`, the second one is packed and shaped as
                `[num_local_experts, num_max_dispatch_tokens_per_rank * num_ranks, hidden // 512]` with type `torch.int`.
                Notice that, the last-two-dimension of the scaling tensors are in column-major for TMA compatibility.
                With `use_fp8=False`, the result would be a tensor shaped as
                `[num_local_experts, num_max_dispatch_tokens_per_rank * num_ranks, hidden]` with `torch.bfloat16`.
                Moreover, not all tokens are valid, only some of the `num_max_dispatch_tokens_per_rank * num_ranks` are,
                as we do not synchronize CPU received count with GPU (also not incompatible with CUDA graph if synced).
